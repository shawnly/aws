To set up DynamoDB for your client application, here are key requirements to ask about:

    Data Structure and Schema:
        What data types and attributes will be stored in each item?
        Do they have specific primary key requirements (partition key only or partition and sort key)?

    Capacity Mode:
        Should the table use on-demand or provisioned capacity mode? Provisioned capacity allows for specific read and write capacity units, while on-demand automatically scales.

    Throughput Requirements:
        What are the expected read and write throughput needs? For provisioned mode, specify initial read and write capacity units.
        Will there be peak usage times, or is the usage consistent?

    Indexes:
        Will they need secondary indexes (Global Secondary Indexes or Local Secondary Indexes) for queries on non-primary key attributes?

    Access Patterns:
        What types of queries will be used? (e.g., by primary key, by secondary indexes, scans).
        Will they perform conditional updates or need specific filters?

    Data Security:
        Do they have specific encryption requirements for data at rest (DynamoDB uses AES-256 encryption by default)?
        Any specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies or roles for access control?

    Backup and Restore:
        Do they need on-demand backups or point-in-time recovery for disaster recovery?

    DynamoDB Streams:
        Will they need DynamoDB Streams to track changes in data for any real-time updates or triggers?

    TTL (Time to Live):
        Should some data items have automatic expiration (TTL) to reduce storage and control costs?

    Geographical Requirements:
        Are there specific AWS regions where the table needs to be deployed for latency or data residency concerns?

Gathering these details will ensure you set up DynamoDB to meet the application's needs effectively. Let me know if youâ€™d like help configuring any of these aspects!
