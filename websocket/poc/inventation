Background:

The project requires sending emails and SMS messages to arbitrary recipients using an on-premises mail server, without the need for recipient confirmation.
Challenges:

Using AWS services like SES and SNS presents challenges:

    Recipient Confirmation: AWS does not provide an API to auto-confirm emails or phone numbers.
    Complex Setup: Networking, DNS configuration for the mail server, and SMS sender number setup add complexity.

Solution:

To address these issues, we've designed a WebSocket API between AWS and the on-prem network. An on-prem WebSocket client will parse the messages and directly send emails/SMS through the mail server, bypassing AWS confirmation requirements.
Demo:

I'll present a Proof of Concept (POC) of this solution at the meeting.

Looking forward to your feedback!
